permalink: /about/

I'm a grad student pursuing my masters in Applied Statistics at California State University-Long Beach.
I graduated in 2022 from George Mason University with my B.S. in Economics and minors in Mathematics and Data Analysis.
I have two passions: helping others learn about statistics and math; and using data to investigate public policy questions.
