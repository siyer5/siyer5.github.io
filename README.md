# Hello and Welcome!
  
## About Me
  
I'm a grad student pursuing my masters in Applied Statistics at California State University-Long Beach. Before coming back to California, I  graduated in 2022 from George Mason University with my B.S. in Economics and minors in Mathematics and Data Analysis. 
I have two passions in my life: helping others learn about statistics and math; and using data to investigate public policy questions. Some current topics of interest for me are cap-and-trade markets and health insurance markets.
